## What is it for:

This is a stm32 project for my lathe
I want to automate some operations, add rpm and some other indicators

TODO list:
- [x] rotary encoder to get speed data from spindle
- [x] spindle `rpm` indicator using 7-segment indicators
- [x] use encoder as digital angle divider 
- [ ] automatic spindle oiling system
- [ ] control speed using 3-phase inverter and mouse-like encoder
- [ ] motor current indicator using inverter special output for it
- [ ] add a few end stops
- [ ] add direct/stop/reverse control lever

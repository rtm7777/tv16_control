This is a stm32 project for my lathe
I want to automate some operations, add rpm and some other indicators

* Add spindle `rpm` indicator using 7-segment indicators
* Add rotary encoder to get speed data from spindle
* Add automatic spindle oiling system
* Control speed using 3-phase inverter and mouse-like encoder
* Add motor current indicator using inverter special output for it
* Add a few end stops
